## Unofficial API

This project is neither created nor endorsed by Yahoo Inc. Yahoo does not
provide any official API to developers, nor makes any guarantees regarding
service availability or API consistency. In practice however, the open source
community has kept this project (and it's predecessor) working well since 2013.

Nevertheless, we make no guarantees and you use this package at your own risk.
The developers (and obviously Yahoo) cannot be held responsible for any losses
you may incur as a result of using this service. Use of this package is
considered acknowledgement and acceptance of these terms and of its license.

## Quickstart

**CLI** (Command line interface)

# or install it

```

See the [Explanatatory Documentation](./docs/README.md) and
[Full API Documentation](https://jsr.io/@gadicc/yahoo-finance2/doc/~/default).

Particularly, make sure to read the notes there on
[ERROR HANDLING](./docs/README.md#error-handling). Be aware that if a stock gets
delisted, Yahoo removes all related data, including historical (and chart) data
from periods _before_ the delisting occurred (i.e. queries that worked before
will start failing, and there is no way to retrieve this data again).

## (Optional) TypeScript Love

Working with `yahoo-finance2` is a joy if you're using TypeScript (but you don't
have to), with type checking and auto completion:

![Types Animation](./docs/img/yf-typescript-demo.gif)

Try it yourself on our
[Live CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/yahoo-finance2-312x2?file=/src/index.ts).

## Using in the Browser

It's not possible to run this in the browser, due to CORS and cookie issues. You
should execute calls on a server or in a serverless or edge function, and pass
this data to the browser as required. See the CodeSandbox above for examples.
Use React Server Components, trpc, or other strategies to maintain types.
